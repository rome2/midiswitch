# RoMe Zimpel MIDI

This is a simple 3 button MIDI footswitch. It was designed to replace the huge original footswitch of my Marshall 6100LM with a smaller alternative. I've used the Digitech FS3X as base for the project as it's very cheap, sturdy and already comes with three latching footswitches. Drilling three holes for the LEDs and one for the MIDI socket makes it a great MIDI pedal.

The microcontroller used was the ATMEGA8 just because I had several of them flying around. It has a lot free IOs so the board could easily be extended with extra functionality (expression pedal, more buttons etc)

The schematic and board were created with KiCad, the code uses the default GNU toolchain for Atmel.
